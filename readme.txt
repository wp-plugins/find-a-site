 About Multi-DB
Multi-DB spreads Multisite content across tens or thousands of database tables.

Lighten Your System Load

The standard WordPress Multisite installation requires only one database – which is great for hobbyists or people just looking to host a few dozen or few hundred sites.

However, when you get to a few hundred sites, especially if they are particularly active sites, things can start to get a little cramped in there as your database now contains thousands of tables and quite likely a fair bit of data too.

Simple, Well-Documented and Great Support

Use Multi-DB on a new site or an existing site – and you don’t need to be a technical genius to work it out. It’s exceptionally well documented and supported in our forums.

It allows you to split your single database into 16, 256 or 4096 databases. And if you are using cPanel, it even incorporates a script that will do that for you.

After that, it’ll distribute your blogs around the databases evenly – giving you peace of mind, much better performance and the confidence to grow your site as much as you desire.

Support Millions of Blogs

It’s the same solution we use on Edublogs.org and is very similar to that used on WordPress.com.

Increase network performance by spreading your data across multiple databases using Multi-DB. For more information please visit https://premium.wpmudev.org/project/multi-db/
